# LogisticRegressionFromScratch


Implemented a single neuron neural network, aka, the logistic regression unit. 
Used Log Loss Function to carry out stochastic gradient descent for optimization with sigmoid and relu activation function.

Compared performance by implementing regularization using the L1 (Lasso) method and L2 (Ridge) methods.
